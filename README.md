# Active-inference

<p>This is a project of active inference implementation in a t-maze task based on a grid environment.</p>
Active inference is a framework that combines action and perception as inference, where an agent minimizes the same function of variational free energy on both of them.
In this project, my aim is to build a friendly environment, where I can change different paraemeters of the models, test the effect and test the relationships between them.
